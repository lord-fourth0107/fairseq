# Environment Issues That Caused SLURM Job Termination

## 🔍 **IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENT ISSUES:**

### **1. 🎯 GPU ID Configuration Issue**
**Problem**: The script uses `--gpu_id` argument but doesn't handle cases where:
- GPU ID >= available GPUs
- CUDA is not available
- Argument parsing fails

**Impact**: Job crashes immediately when trying to access invalid GPU

**Fix**: Added safe GPU ID handling with fallbacks

### **2. 📁 Data Path Mismatch**
**Problem**: Script has hardcoded path:
```python
data_loading_path = "/scratch/mkp6112/LFP/region_decoding/script/Allen_w2v2/Allen"
```
But your data is at:
```python
data_loading_path = "/scratch/us2193/neural_probe_data"
```

**Impact**: Script can't find data files, crashes during dataset creation

**Fix**: Updated to use correct path with fallback handling

### **3. 🚫 Missing Error Handling**
**Problem**: Script lacks comprehensive error handling for:
- File path access
- Dataset creation
- Model initialization
- Training loop failures

**Impact**: Any failure causes immediate job termination

**Fix**: Added try-catch blocks around all critical operations

### **4. 📂 Output Path Permissions**
**Problem**: Script tries to create output directories without checking permissions:
```python
output_path = f"/vast/us2193/ssl_output/{data}/{data_type}/wav2vec2_2d/across_session"
```

**Impact**: Job crashes if output directory creation fails

**Fix**: Added safe directory creation with fallback paths

### **5. 🔧 Argument Parsing Issues**
**Problem**: Script expects command line arguments but doesn't handle:
- Missing arguments
- Invalid argument values
- Argument parsing failures

**Impact**: Job crashes during argument parsing

**Fix**: Added safe argument parsing with defaults

### **6. 🐍 Import Dependencies**
**Problem**: Script imports modules that might not be available:
- `modified_session_dataset`
- `blind_localization.data.lazyloader_dataset`
- Various scientific computing libraries

**Impact**: Job crashes during import phase

**Fix**: Added import error handling and validation

### **7. 💾 Memory Management**
**Problem**: Script doesn't handle:
- GPU memory allocation failures
- Out-of-memory errors
- Memory leaks during training

**Impact**: Job gets killed by SLURM due to memory issues

**Fix**: Added memory optimization and error handling

### **8. 🔄 Infinite Loops**
**Problem**: Training loops might get stuck due to:
- Dimension mismatches
- Model forward pass failures
- Data loading issues

**Impact**: Job runs indefinitely until SLURM kills it

**Fix**: Added progress indicators and timeout protection

## 🛠️ **SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:**

### **1. Fixed Script (`wav2vec2_2d_single_gpu_fixed.py`)**
- ✅ Safe GPU ID handling
- ✅ Correct data path
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Safe argument parsing
- ✅ Memory optimization
- ✅ Progress indicators

### **2. Diagnostic Script (`diagnose_environment_issues.py`)**
- ✅ Environment validation
- ✅ Dependency checking
- ✅ Path verification
- ✅ Resource assessment

### **3. Test Scripts**
- ✅ `test_setup.py` - Basic functionality test
- ✅ `test_setup_direct.sh` - Quick environment test
- ✅ `run_training_direct.sh` - Direct training with fixes

## 🎯 **MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF JOB TERMINATION:**

**Data Path Issue** - The script was looking for data at:
```
/scratch/mkp6112/LFP/region_decoding/script/Allen_w2v2/Allen
```

But your data is at:
```
/scratch/us2193/neural_probe_data
```

This would cause the script to:
1. Not find any pickle files
2. Create empty datasets
3. Crash during training loop
4. Get killed by SLURM

## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Run diagnostic script first**:
   ```bash
   ./test_setup_direct.sh
   ```

2. **If diagnostic passes, run fixed training**:
   ```bash
   ./run_training_direct.sh
   ```

3. **Monitor the output for any remaining issues**

The fixed script should resolve all the environment issues that were causing your job to be killed!
